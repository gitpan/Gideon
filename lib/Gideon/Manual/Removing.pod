invoked, B<please make sure you read and understand the documentation> as missues
of this method can cause data corruption

Calling C<remove> as a class method will remove a group of objects from a data
store, additionally you can filter objects to be remove by providing C<%opts>
and it works in the same way as C<find> method does.

   # Remove all named John
   People->remove(name => 'John');

   # Remove all objects
   People->remove;

When C<remove> is called to a particular instance it removes that particular
instance without affecting other objects

    # Remove first person
    People->find_one(id =>1)->remove;
